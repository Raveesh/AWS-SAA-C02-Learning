# Notes prepared for SAA-C02 certification. 

These notes are prepared using the [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking app on linux. The main material for the notes comes from [Adrian Cantrill's Course](https://learn.cantrill.io/).Apart from that any other reading materials that I go through, I would have linked them in the notes.
